# MIPS
Assembler Problems

This repository contains a collection of small and simple assembler programs written in MIPS using MARS, a MIPS assembly language simulator and IDE. These programs are meant to serve as examples and resources for anyone interested in learning MIPS assembly programming.

To use this repository, simply clone it to your local machine using Git. You will need to have MARS installed on your system to assemble and run the programs. Once you have MARS installed, open the program file in MARS and assemble and run it from within the IDE.

Mars installation Guide:

1. Download the latest version of MARS from the official website (http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/).
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Double-click on the "Mars.jar" file to start the MARS application.


Happy assembling!
